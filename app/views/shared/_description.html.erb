        Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of <a href="#">Iwate Prefecture</a>, 2.5 hours by
        shinkansen north of <a href="#">Tokyo</a>. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and
        blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a
        convenient transportation hub, but lacks a major sightseeing spot.
        The city is well known for its various styles of noodles, though,
        and does offer a handful of minor sites of interest.
