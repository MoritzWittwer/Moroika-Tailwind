        Morioka (盛岡) is the capital city of <a class="underline text-red-800" href="#">Iwate Prefecture</a>, 2.5 hours by
        shinkansen north of <a class="underline text-red-800" href="#">Tokyo</a>. Surrounded by mountains on three sides and
        blessed with multiple rivers, Morioka is an attractive city and a
        convenient transportation hub, but lacks a major sightseeing spot.
        The city is well known for its various styles of noodles, though,
        and does offer a handful of minor sites of interest.

        <p class= "text-gray-500 font-extralight text-sm leading-5">
          Morioka Sansa Odori Festival, held from August 1 through 4, is one of
          the Five Great Festivals of Tohoku. Over 10,000 taiko drummers and
          dancers parade through the city; Sansa is listed in the Guinness Book
          of Records as the largest taiko drum festival in the world.

          Eating Wanko Soba is an experience in itself. Each serving contains
          roughly a mouthful of soba noodles, and the server will constantly keep
          topping up your empty bowl with more noodles until you indicate that you
          have had enough.
